# AGENTS.md

## Introduction
This repository is documentation + configuration (Markdown-first). Optimize for readability and minimal diffs.

## Purpose and scope
- Repository purpose: [one sentence describing what this repo documents/contains]
- Allowed changes:
  - Edit Markdown docs and configuration files.
  - Add new docs in the appropriate folder (see “Project map”).
- Not allowed (unless explicitly requested):
  - Large refactors/restructures (moving many files, renaming sections globally).
  - Reformatting entire documents “for style” unless the task requests it.
  - Renaming files (case-sensitive) without a clear reason and updated references.

If requirements are ambiguous, ask before making broad changes.

## Important files (read before changing behavior/structure)
- ARCHITECTURE.md — overall design and repo structure
- STYLE.md — writing + formatting conventions
- CHANGELOG.md — user-visible changes (keep it current)

## Quick start (commands)
- Install hooks: `pre-commit install`
- Run all checks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- [If you have any other checks, list them here exactly, e.g. markdownlint, link checker, docs build]

## Project map
- `/` — top-level docs and configs
- `[docs/ or other folders if present]` — what belongs there
- `[templates/ etc]` — what belongs there
-  `[test/ etc]`  — e2e test files or others

## Writing and style rules (reader-optimized)
- Prefer declarative, intention-revealing writing.
- Keep sections short; avoid repetition.
- Use consistent headings and terminology (follow STYLE.md).
- Avoid mass whitespace/format-only changes unless required.
